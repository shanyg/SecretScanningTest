# My Secret Scanning Test Project

This repository is purely for testing secret scanning tools. It contains various intentionally placed dummy secrets (tokens, keys, passwords, etc.) across different file types to simulate real-world scenarios.

**DO NOT USE ANY OF THE "SECRETS" FOUND HERE. THEY ARE FAKE AND NON-FUNCTIONAL.**

## Getting Started
